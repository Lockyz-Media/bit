# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We only support two major versions of Bit.
Older versions will still receive security updates however.

| Version | Supported          | Security Updates?          |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 2025.2.x   | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| 2025.1.x   | :x: | :white_check_mark: |
| 2024.2.x   | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| 2024.1.x   | :x: | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.2.x and below   | :x: | :x: |

Each version of Bit enters End of Support about 6 months after the next major version releases. This means that, that specific version won't receive feature or small updates from us. Though they will still receive security updates.

About a year and 6 months after that versions enter End of Life. These versions no longer get security updates.

Then a year after that actual compiled downloads, and outright source downloads will be deleted.
