# Bit
## Bit Rewrite
As part of our comittment to continuously improving Bit we have decided to completely rewrite Bit from the ground up. This means completely changing EVERYTHING.

### What can be expected as part of this rewrite?
We hope to severely improve our plugins system. We also hope that this rewrite improves stability.

We also intend to improve our localisation system.

### What is the status of the rewrite?
Right now we're figuring out where to start. We don't predict to have anything to show for it for a while now.

The rewrite is currently being done in its own fork, so you unfortunetly won't be able to see any progress for a while.

## Original Information
Bit is a custom bot framework created by Lockyz Media.

The entire point of the bot is to be as simplistic in design as possible, and allow for infinite expansion through plugins.

Make sure to read our documentation for more detailed instructions on installing the bot, creating plugins, and other information. [Documentation](https://bit.lockyzdev.net/)
